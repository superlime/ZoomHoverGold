ZoomHover GOLD! 
=========

Fork of Hover Free, which was a fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.

Read why Hover Free was created: https://gist.github.com/ralph-tice/5087704 or see http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19oy0s/hoverzoom_has_gone_evil_tracking_browsing_history/ for discussion.

Unfortunately, Ralph Tice decided to stop further development of Hover Free.  I really wanted purple links visited via Hover Free to sync across computers, and got the crazy idea that I could implement it myself: http://www.reddit.com/r/goldbenefits/comments/1p59nm/remember_what_links_youve_visited_across_computers/cgnhjvj

Philosophy:
===========

ZoomHover GOLD! will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.

ZoomHover GOLD! will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.

ZoomHover GOLD! will never track or record browsing activity without you specifically telling it to (i.e. Reddit Gold visited links work by submitting a POST request to the Reddit API, telling it you visited a link.  To get this functionality, you have to explicitly enable it in the options.  Default setting is off.)

ZoomHover GOLD! source and change history will always be visible on github, for maximum transparency into any updates or modifications.
